While rates of deforestation have decreased in the recent past from a net annual forest area loss of 7.3 hectares in 2000 to 3.3 hectares in 2015, they are still alarmingly high. The main driver of deforestation to be conversion of forests to agricultural land. In addition, forest degradation is increasing globally, mainly due to unsustainable use, often driven by poverty or poor land governance. Mountains cover about 22 percent of the Earth’s surface and are vital sources of , energy, biodiversity, agricultural products and livelihoods for a large portion of the ’s population. In 2017, 76 per cent of mountain areas were by some form of green vegetation, forests, shrubs, grassland and cropland, which tends to be positively correlated to the health of the mountains and their capacity to provide ecosystem ; but mountain ecosystems and the people who inhabit them are highly vulnerable to disturbances. About one fifth of the Earth’s land surface by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1998 to 2013. Up to 24 km2 of land was affected, 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forestland, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. In some cases, advanced stages of land degradation are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. It is estimated that 60 per cent of terrestrial biodiversity loss is related to production, while ecosystem to production are under pressure, with 33 per cent of soils moderately to highly degraded and freshwater ecosystems adversely impacted by extraction for agriculture and other uses, and by pollution.5 Globally, around 3.2 billion people are adversely affected by land degradation, and an estimated two billion hectares—equivalent to 17 per cent of all biologically productive land—could benefit from restoration.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, the emergence of key agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Geneva UN Charter on Sustainable Housing, the New Urban Agenda, the Paris Agreement, and the Basel III Agreement, have led to the establishment of new and regional policy frameworks for future activities on urban development at all levels.

Moreover, this version of the Policy Framework for Sustainable Real Estate Markets maintains that, contrary to the widespread belief that finance and real estate sectors have negative impact on sustainability, they can actually contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals with the of effective and compatible principles.
